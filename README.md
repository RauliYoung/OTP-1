# OTP-1
OTP-1 is a health tracker software project designed especially for people that want to track how they move.


## Project planning
Our project goal is to produce an easy-to-use simple fitness application for Android.
The software provides functions to track and analyze data produced by own activities, such as time and length.
The user is also provided with a possibility to create and manage groups.


# Firestore
The application uses firestore as a nonSql database.
